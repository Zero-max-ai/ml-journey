# Seaborn practice question 
- to get more understanding of it features and understand the proper grasp of visualization of the datapoints.

## Titanic Dataset:
Survival Insights:
- Did survival rates differ by gender or class? (Women and children first?)
- How does age affect survival chances?
- Were fares higher for survivors or non-survivors?

Fare Distribution:
- Did wealthier passengers (higher fare) have better chances of survival?
- Identify outliers in fare distributions.

Family Size Impact:
- Did having siblings/spouses or parents/children influence survival?

Heatmap (Correlation Matrix):
- What variables are strongly correlated with survival?

## Iris Dataset:
Species Differentiation:
- How do the features (sepal/petal length/width) vary across species?
- Which feature separates species the most (using pairplot or scatterplot)?

Box/Violin Plots:
- Are there overlapping distributions between species for any features?

Pairplot:
- Can you visually identify clusters between species?

Outliers:
- Do any species/features have unusual values?
